# city of the Future: a People's History of New Lamberton
### Written By: Kristof Namsouh
## Preface
To my loyal fans and interested readers, this compendium has taken years of my life and is a codified history of The Kingdom of Ordegg. Specifically, it is a collection of stories and historys curated by someone who was born and has made a life for himself inside of New Lamberton following a short stint as an adventurer. I treasure these stories, and I know you will love to learn more about our great city.
